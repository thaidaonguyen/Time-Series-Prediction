# Time Series/Forecast Prediction 

Time Series Prediction using Keras LSTM with Tensorflow backend 

This repository is my experimental code for Keras LSTM with Google's Tensorflow backend,
It is mostly taken from Jacob Aungier's blog:
http://www.jakob-aungiers.com/articles/a/LSTM-Neural-Network-for-Time-Series-Prediction  

LSTM is an algorithm used where there are lots of data and 
where sequential data matter such as financial forecast,
sensor's time series, NLP tasks, image processing, ect
It is the foundation to many advanced neural networks.

Colah's blog explains this concept very well:

This currency example only includes few features.  In a real
financial market world, many factors can influence the market and must be 
include when architecting models.  However, when problems are framed
appropriately, LSTM can be a very useful analytics tool.
